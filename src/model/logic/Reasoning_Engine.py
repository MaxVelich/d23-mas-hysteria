This class is currently empty. Here we intend to provide the logic for how the agents reason about the environment, other agents, and the panic. 
The reasoning engine will mainly incorporate Theory of Mind to reason about surrounding agents.
We will start by working with agents that apply first order Theory of Mind (ToM1) and agents that do not apply Theory of Mind (ToM0)
ToM0 agents will simply move towards an exit based on the path finding algorithm
ToM1 agents will try to reason about the paths that their surrounding agents will take, by simulating what they would do in their place if they were a ToM0 agent
