# MAS Hysteria

This is the very first alpha version of our project. Obviously, the implementation is very minimal at this point. However, we do draw some agents that head towards a central exit currently. If you run main.py, you should see your browser opening the page on the localhost.

## How to run?

In order to run the program, first install all requirements by running the following command in a fresh new Python 3.7.3 environment:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, run:

```
python main.py
```
